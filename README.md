## Getting Started

### Installation

You can either download the source code here and build it in `DEBUG | ANY CPU` or download it from my official site [FrostChanger.de](https://frostchanger.de)

2. Set your Game to Fullscreen + Aspect Ratio "Fill".
3. Restart your Game & select Windowed. (Aspect Ratio still needs to be "Fill")
4. Change your Resolution with the Tool.
5. Enjoy Stretched Resolution
